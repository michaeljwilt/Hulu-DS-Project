To view the code and all its output, please open the "Hulu Project Jupyter" File

To view initial code in RStudio, please open the "Hulu Project.R" file

The purpose of this project was to determine what we could about these 2 variables:
  1. imdb_scores
  2. tmdb_popularity


I then ran the following analysis after cleaning and sorting the data:
  1. Pearson correlation between the 2 variables
  2. ANOVA test for each variable with "seasons" as my dependent variable
  3. To test for assumptions before running the ANOVA, I ran tests for the following:
      - Normality
      - Homgeneity of Variance
      - Post Hoc Pairewise Tests


I hope you enjoy and can learn something from this analysis. You will find my conclusions at the end of the project files.


Please feel free to share any thoughts. Thank you!
