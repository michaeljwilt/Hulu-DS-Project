<p> <strong>In this project we take a look at the impact of IMDB Scores and TMDB Popularity on the season lengths for TV Shows. </strong></p>

Which could be a better predictor of seasons long tv shows? Let's find out!

For exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing purposes we performed the following:
  1. Merged and wrangled our 2 datasets
  2. Performed pearson correlations between our variables
  3. Recoded our independent variables to prepare for the Anova
  4. Tested and corrected our assumptions for the Anova
  5. Ran Anova

Conclusions:

- TMDB Popularity is a better predictor of whether a show will have multiple seasons. The higher the popularity the more seasons on average
- IMDB Scores had the opposite affect. The lower the score the more likely a show was to have more seasons. There was indeed a negative correlation

#We can assume that TMDB Popularity is a better predictor because it gives us real time data of shows that are being watched whether for the first time
or are what we would call "Cult Classics." The more a is watched the higher its popularity will be. IMDB Scores however, can be skewed positively and negatively based on peeoples biases as well as other external factors.
